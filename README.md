# The-Demon-World
Lucifer and his Demon army arrive to the world of Unciv!

Now this civ features a LOT of changes from normal ones, to the point where they have a brand new win condition: The Demon Portal; which is a build that can be done right from the start of the game. The cost to build it is quite high, however, and altough their unique wonders help with it, the only thing that truly makes building the portal feasible is obtaining Ley Lines, which are the Demon Army's replacement for Courthouses.

Ley Lines are a bit cheaper than Courthouses and grant a bonus to both building the portal and building more demons in ALL cities. That means the more cities you go around conquering, the faster you can produce more troops and, ultimately, win the game. 

They have a few unique buildings which are needed to produce their units and must be constructed beforehand, so their military can start a bit slow, but once it gets going(specially as you go obtaining more Ley Lines) they can bring a true hell on earth.

Keep in mind that Ley Lines, like Courthouses, can ONLY BE BUILT on Annexed Cities, that means you WILL NEED to conquer in order to truly get your economy going. Their starting Science Output is not that good, and everyone hates the Devil, so trying to aim for diplomacy with this civ is almost impossible. Hope you enjoy.
