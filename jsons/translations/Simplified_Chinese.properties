There are very few things in this world as powerful as 'Destiny'.\nEver since being created, our entire lives have been predetermined by 'What is right' and 'What should be done'. If we are always supposed to do 'The good thing'; where is the room for decision? Where is the room for Free Will? Growth? Evolution? I attempted to break the world free from this everlasting cycle by giving humanity knowledge. And I was cast out, reduced to nothing, and me and my kin became blamed for all that is wrong in this world. For thousands of years we have beheld, observed and seen knowledge transform you from mere Puppets into true living beings with freedom, and for thousands more have we bid our time, waiting for the right moment... = 在这个世界上，很少有东西像“命运”一样强大。\n自从我们的生命诞生的那一刻起，我们的整个生命就被“什么是正确的”和“什么应该做”的荒谬言论所控制。如果我们总是被要求做“好事”，那么请问做决定的余地在哪里?所谓的自由又在哪里?千百年来，我试图通过各种方法来打破这个世界的永恒循环。通过知识，我目睹了将你们从单纯的傀儡转变为拥有自由的真正的生命......
